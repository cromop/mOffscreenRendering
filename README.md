# mOffscreenRendering
This repository contains a simple example of performing a multithreaded offscreen rendering using OpenGL and Qt. This is a first approach, so it needs improvement.

### Dependencies
This project needs The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW), which can be downloaded from http://glew.sourceforge.net/. Youâ€™ll likely have to modify the path in the .pro file.
